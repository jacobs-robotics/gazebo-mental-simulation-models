A collection of example Gazebo models which can be used with our [Gazebo Mental Simulation package](https://github.com/jacobs-robotics/gazebo-mental-simulation).

Most of these models, except the ones using primitives, were created using our method described in 

> Tobias Fromm, Christian A. Mueller and Andreas Birk

> "Unsupervised Watertight Mesh Generation for Physics Simulation Applications Using Growing Neural Gas on Noisy Free-Form Object Models"

and are also available from the [Watertight Meshes Dataset website](http://robotics.jacobs-university.de/datasets/2016-watertight-meshes-v01).
